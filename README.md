# AccurateTextures
Accurate Textures x32 Minecraft resource pack
Original idea by GodRage, on https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture-pack/accurate-textures/

<h2>Original Idea</h2>
-Original color only: no new colors in the image.
-Same amount of color: Histogram Average channel #color is identical to original 16x16 texture.
-Respect of Minecraft: iconic parts of the design will be preserved. (a line of 1 pixel wide in 16x16 is 2 pixel wide in 32x32)
-Optifine is not needed.
-This pack aims on blocks/items.
