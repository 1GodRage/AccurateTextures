<h2>Original Idea</h2>

- Original color only: no new colors in the image.
- Same amount of color: Histogram Average channel #color is identical to original 16x16 texture.
- Respect of Minecraft: iconic parts of the design will be preserved. (a line of 1 pixel wide in 16x16 is 2 pixel wide in 32x32)
- Optifine is not needed.
- This pack aims on blocks & items.
- If possible: keep 3/4 of pixel original color at the same position.
