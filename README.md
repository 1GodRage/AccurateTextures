# AccurateTextures
Accurate Textures x32 Minecraft resource pack
Original idea by GodRage, on https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture-pack/accurate-textures/

Original Idea is:
Original color only: no new colors in the image.
Same amount of color: Histogram Average channel #color is identical to original 16x16 texture.
Respect of Minecraft: iconic parts of the design will be preserved. (a line of 1 pixel wide in 16x16 is 2 pixel wide in 32x32)

This pack aims on blocks/items.
Optifine is not needed.


== Making an Accurate Texture ==
- Original 16x16 texture > Paint-like program > upscale to 32x32.
By importance order:
1- Original color only: no new colors into the image.
2- Keep the same amount of pixels for each color. (Histogram Average channel must be the same #color)
3- Keep the same amount of pixels for the most dark/bright color in any texture. (kind of 2bis)
4- Respect the block: do not touch what make this block recognizable, or its particularity.
5- Diagonal lines must be changed to be more lines than stairs.
6- Touch the texture the less possible; most of original pixelsÂ² must keep 3 pixels of its original color. (Squared blocks only)

- And then, post it in the comment section, if you want to add it to the next version of this pack: with written permission for me to add it in this texture pack.
- Playtest with this texture for couple weeks, if it is matching, it's accepted.
